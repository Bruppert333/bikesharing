## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to look at the New York City bike sharing data and come up with questions we would want to ask. Once we had our questions, we filtered the data we had to answer questions like: What are the most popular start and stop locations? How long are bikes checked out for all riders and genders? How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders? What days of the week are users more likely to check out a bike?
